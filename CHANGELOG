Version 1.1.7
=============

- Escaping synchronized non-ascii characters in `TagGroup` keys and string values and unescaping 
  them in python again to prevent DigitalMicrograph crashing due to encoding problems
- Removing deprecated structure definition of `TagGroup`s and `TagList`s
- Adding conversion support from `dm-script` UInt32 to python `int` and `dm-script` UInt16 to python
  `int`

Version 1.1.6
=============

- Adding `remove_global_tag()` with example in README
- Adding `debug_file` can be any file object which includes `sys.stdout` to directly print out the 
  code to execute
- Adding `get_persistent_tag()` with example in README
- Adding deprecation warning when defining the strucutre of `TagGroup`s or `TagList`s in the 
  `readvars` in the `exec_dmscript()` function

Version 1.1.5
=============

- Adding `invalid_taggroup_key_characters` tuple that contains character that are invalid for 
  DigitalMicrograph TagGroup key names
- Adding `replace_invalid_chars` parameter to `convert_to_taggroup()` to offer automatic replacing
  of invalid TagGroup key names
- Improving raised errors and their message in `convert_to_taggroup()` to explain better what the 
  error is about
- Improve doc comment of `convert_to_taggroup()`
- Fix `convert_to_taggroup()` function by fixing call of a non-existing function due to a typo

Version 1.1.4
=============

- Adding `__file__` variable is now always given in dm-script containing the current dm-script file
  path
- Adding ingore markers `@execdmscript.ignore.start` and `@execdmscript.ignore.end` to allow code 
  that is only executed in direct dm-script calls
- Adding `convert_from_taggroup()` function that converts `DigitalMicrograph.Py_TagGroup` to 
  `dict`s, `list`s which is the opposite function to `convert_to_taggroup()`
- Adding helper documentation in README
- Adding examples for `get_dm_type()` and `get_python_type()`
- Adding examples for `escape_dm_variable()` and `escape_dm_string()`
- Adding examples for `convert_from_taggroup()` and `convert_to_taggroup()`

Version 1.1.3
=============

- Adding `convert_to_taggroup()` function that converts `dict`s, `list`s and `tuple`s to a 
  `DigitalMicrograph.Py_TagGroup` directly.
- Changing imports in `__init__.py` to import everything

Version 1.1.2
=============

- Fixing error when synchronizing `TagGroup`s and the `TagGroup` is invalid in dm-script

Version 1.1.1
=============

- Rewriting big parts of the README to make it more understandable
- Adding more and easier examples

Big thanks to BmyGuest

Version 1.1.0
=============

- Adding `__version__` to module
- Adding VERSION file
- Adding `separate_thread` option to allow execution of dm-script in a separate dm-script thread
  
Version 1.0.2
=============

- Adding new error class `DMScriptError`
- Checking dm-script execution on runtime dm-script errors, displaying them to the user with
  corrected line numbers

Version 1.0.1
=============

- Fixing dm-script strings were failing when they contained a special character (e.g. \ or "), they 
  are escaped now
- Fixing value of `debug_file` was ignored
- Changing default `debug_file` path is now relative to the current working directory
